If you want money in your pocket
and a top hat on your head
a hot meal on your table
and a blanket on your bed

> a C D F E a E

well today is grey skies
tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here

> a E a E a C D E

I'm going to New York City
and I'm leaving on a train
and if you want to stay behind and
wait til I come back again

> a C D F E a E

well today is grey skies
tomorrow is tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here

> a F a F a D E

If you want to go
where the rainbows end
you'll have to say goodbye
all our dreams come true
baby up ahead
and it's out where your memories lie

> a E a E a C D E

The road's out before me
and the moon is shining bright
what I want you to remember
as I disappear tonight

> a C D F E a E

today is grey skies
tomorrow's tears
you'll have to wait til yesterday is here
