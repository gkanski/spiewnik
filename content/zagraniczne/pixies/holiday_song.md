> a C F C

```
Well sit right down my wicked son
And let me tell you a story
About the boy who fell from glory
And how he was a wicked son
```

> G F <br> a C F C <br> G F D

```
This ain't no holiday
But it always turn out this way
Here I am, with my hand
```

> a C F C

```
He took his sister from his head
And then painted her on the sheets
And then rolled her up in grass and trees
And they kissed till they were dead
```

> G F <br> a C F C <br> G F D

```
This ain't no holiday
But it always turns out this way
Here I am, with my hand
```

> a C F C

```
Well sit right down my evil son
And let me tell you a story
About the boy who fell from glory
And how he was a wicked son
```

> G F <br> a C F C <br> G F D

```
This ain't no holiday, oh no
But it always turns out this way
Here I am, with my hand
```
